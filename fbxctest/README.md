# `fbxctest`

`fbxctest` acts as a commandline for leveraging `XCTestBootrap` via `xctool`'s command line interface and json output.

Over time, the test execution aspects of `idb` will come to replace all of it's functionality in a single place. For now, it acts as a replacement for `xctool` that is integrated directly in `buck`.
